# Secure Organ Donation using Blockchain

This project implements a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for managing organ donation records using blockchain technology. It aims to eliminate fraud, increase trust, and ensure fair donor-recipient matching through smart contracts.

# Project Objectives
- Ensure data immutability and transparency in the organ donation process
- Automate donor-recipient matching using smart contracts
- Provide secure, role-based access to hospitals, patients, and authorities
- Prevent data manipulation and unauthorized access

# Features
- Blockchain-based registration for donors and recipients
- Smart contract-driven organ matching and verification
- Real-time organ availability tracking
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Tamper-proof medical recordkeeping

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity  
- Tools: MetaMask, Ganache, Truffle or Hardhat  
- Optional: IPFS or MongoDB for storing off-chain data

# Motivation
Traditional organ donation systems suffer from lack of transparency, fraud, and inefficiencies. This project uses blockchain to ensure that all records are immutable, traceable, and accessible only to verified users.

# Use Case Workflow
1. Donors and recipients register through the platform
2. Hospitals verify users and update organ availability
3. Smart contracts match suitable donors and recipients
4. All data is stored securely on the blockchain
5. Authorities can monitor the system in real time
